UPDATE: Turns out running selenium on a heroku webworker isn't an established thing. PhantomJS will work better since buildpacks exist for it, this will require a rewrite of the crawler logic in the jobs =/

This is a basic rails app setup for the purpose of automated testing. A front end accepts user params to execute a defined set of tests on defined applications on the G5 Platform. It has gems that allow a variety of driver tests, but can be configured to run any kind of test in a background process handled by resque/redis. It's currently a proof of concept, but can be scaled easily.

To Run the app 
install gems: bundle install
start server: rails server
start redis: redis-server
start workers: 
bundle exec rake environment resque:work QUEUE=CMS
bundle exec rake environment resque:work QUEUE=CLW

Tests are located in the app/jobs directory
